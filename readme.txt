Never lose a sale due to an out-of-stock product again. Automatically notify your customers when their favorite items are back in stock and recover lost revenue.

== Description ==

Stock Notifier Pro for WooCommerce is the easiest way to create a waitlist for your out-of-stock products. When a product is unavailable, an email subscription form is automatically displayed. As soon as you update the stock, all subscribed customers are instantly notified by email that the product is available for purchase again.

This helps you gauge demand for out-of-stock items, recover potentially lost sales, and build customer loyalty by keeping them engaged.
